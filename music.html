									<p>Brian B Greene: Echo & Xplode<br />
									(September 20, 2019, Reset Industries)<br />
									</p>
								</header>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/echoXplode.jpg" alt="" /></span>Brian B Greene's 'Echo & Xplode'EP is the fifth release on Belfast-based boutique label, Reset Industries.
									In these four tracks, Greene strengthens his lyrical intent through a unique musical lens, finding intensity in full emotive productions. The multi-instrumentalist maintains a focus on vocals while deploying ambient keys, deep bass textures and intimate grooves.
									Densely layered vocal harmonies are at the heart of the soulful 'All is Real' and the beat driven meander of 'Half in Half'. Strong dynamic arcs weave their way through the productions of 'Carve a Blue Stone' and'Xplode', a song that captures the obscured memory of a bombing in Northern Ireland.

									<p>Barry Lynn & Brian Greene: Remote Relations<br />
									(March 9, 2015, Kinnego Records)<br />
									</p>
								</header>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/remoteRelations.jpeg" alt="" /></span>Kinnego comes full circle! Originally started as a platform for vocal collaborations between Barry Lynn and Brian Greene (formerly of Kinnego Flux), here we have a short EP of sweet, skype-mediated balladry. In the 6 years since KGO001 was released, Barry and
									Brian have collaborated together on several Boxcutter albums, especially on The Dissolve, released on Planet Mu in 2011. Brian has recently relocated to Berlin and is currently working on his own music (he's a talented multi-instrumentalist as well as singer).
									
									Lead track "As If U" flips some D50 flutes, bass guitar and a jazz fusion sample into a deep, hollow-sounding track that Brian complements with lyrics exploring themes of benevolence and exploitation.
									Remote Relations has already cropped up in some Boxcutter mixes, including the FabricLive mix from 2012. Here we present the definitive version, a pulsing bass guitar driven track with a wistful vocal delivery musing on long distance relationships.
									Finally, "What It Means" is a wintry, spectral boogie track with a sweet drop full of instrumental overtones and crackling drums.</p>

									</header>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/kabdriver.jpeg" alt="" /></span>The fella best known as Kinnego Flux debuts his Kab Driver alias with a taut selection of boogie-funked and rhythm-driven IDM. It's rare groove for a red-light bar on Mars, blessed with a fruity kinda sleaze that's largely down to his dextrous musicality, and no doubt the taste for jazz and electro-boogie he shares with fellow northern Irishman, Boxcutter, who lends his chops to a coupla tracks. If we're gonna pick some highlights, the vocoder heat of 'Garçon' would be up there, as would the techy dubstep funk of 'Batteria' with Boxcutter and Brian Greene, or the Jimmy Edgar-esque future-boogie of 'Never Say Never', but you're probably gonna have your own.</p>

									<p>Boxcutter & Kinnego Flux: A Familiar Sound<br />
									(February 9, 2009, Kinnego Records)<br />
									</p>
								</header>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/familiarSound.jpeg" alt="" /></span>Boxcutter’s work, due to its bass-led and rhythmically 2-step nature, is often categorised as dubstep, although in style and idiosyncracies has more in common with IDM artists such as Squarepusher and μ-Ziq. On this project Boxcutter has teamed up with Kinnego Flux (Belfast based band/ensemble) to combine funk and soul music with electronics using instruments, vocals, computers and hardware synths and modules.

									A Familiar Sound flows seamlessly with stabs of sound rolling over each other without
									ever quite meeting. It's totally unique, and has been blowing minds after it was first heard on Scuba's Electronic Explorations mix. This track is so creative and brilliantly excuted, MASSIVE props to Boxcutter for fusing smooth RnB with a deep and dark drop that takes the tune right into the unexpected. Sounding a bit like Prince, Spacek, Burial and beyond, 'A familiar Sound' will appeal to dubstep heads, beat knodders and jazz fans alike!</p>
